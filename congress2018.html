						<p>
							IEEE SLSYWC 2018 was held from 28th December 2018 to 30th December 2018.It is the very first
							congress for our Student Branch.Nine of us went from our student branch.We were boarded in
							Sri Lanka Technological Campusâ€™ hostel for 3 days.Congress Opening ceremony and IEEE Sanniya
							day was the first day which is Friday 28th of December.Registrations took place and students
							were admitted to the hostels and assigned to groups with breakfast,lunch and dinner tokens

							at congress and they said they are very strict and will punish those who are breaking
							rules.It is somewhat funny listening to their conversations.They made awareness about mobile
							event app Echowave we used for congress.

						<p>
							We had a session called IEEE for dummies where Subodha Charles and Pasan Pathiyagoda talked
							about how they got into IEEE and now what they gained from IEEE.This talk is mainly focused
							on anyone can volunteer for IEEE even if they are not so technical and through their efforts
							,they can get something meaningful from it.
						</p>
